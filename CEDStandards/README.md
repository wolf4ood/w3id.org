# The Common Education Data Standards (CEDS) Ontology

[CEDS](https://ceds.ed.gov/Default.aspx) is an education data management initiative whose purpose is to streamline the understanding of data within and across P-20W institutions and sectors. The CEDS initiative includes a common vocabulary, data models that reflect that vocabulary, tools to help education stakeholders understand and use education data, an assembly of metadata from other education data initiatives, and a community of education stakeholders who discuss the uses of CEDS and the development of the standard.

CEDS resources are all open-source and can be found on our github site: [CEDStandards](https://github.com/CEDStandards)

The core expression of CEDS is the CEDS Ontology. The rdf file can be found here: [CEDS Ontology](https://github.com/CEDStandards/CEDS-Ontology/tree/main) and a user friendly search tool can be found here: [CEDS Website](https://ceds.ed.gov/desHome.aspx#/)

Version 14 of the CEDS Ontology is expected to be released in March 2026.
