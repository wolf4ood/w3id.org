Repository (italia/public-administration-governance) for redirecting to ontologies and open data of Department for Public Administration of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers
===================

We are using **w3id.org/italia/public-administration-governance** for national persistent URIs for public administration governance.

We are initially creating:
+ `w3id.org/italia/public-administration-governance/onto` for all the ontologies of the network mentioned above
+ `w3id.org/italia/public-administration-governance/controlled-vocabulary` for all the controlled vocabularies
+ `w3id.org/italia/public-administration-governance/data` for all the other types of data


Some redirect rules will be to the [github repository of DipartimentoFunzionePubblicaPCM](https://github.com/DipartimentoFunzionePubblicaPCM/DFP-NDC) we are using as semantic assets repo, open to all.
